This directory contains the Fortran 77 source code of the oscillator
program. The file make.sh shows the basic steps in compiling, linking,
(and if desired) installing the program. The compiler used in make.sh
is g77 (GNU's Fortran 77 compiler, which is open source code), but any
standard Fortran 77 compiler can be used. The program must be
installed in a directory found in your PATH environment variable.
In make.sh we use $scripting/$MACHINE_TYPE/bin, but you can of course
copy the executable to any other appropriate directory.

If you do not have a Fortran 77 compiler, you can use a (slower)
Python version found in ../Python, or you can compile a C version of
the oscillator code found in ../C-f2c. The C version was automatically
translated from the Fortran 77 version by means of the program f2c.
This requires the compiled C files to be linked with the libf2c
library.
