This directory contains the C source code of the oscillator
program. The file make.sh shows the basic steps in compiling, linking,
(and if desired) installing the program. The compiler used in make.sh
is gcc (GNU's C compiler, which is open source code), but any standard
ANSI C compiler can be used.  The C source was automatically
translated from the Fortran 77 version by means of the program f2c.
This requires the compiled C files to be linked with the libf2c
library. The original Fortran 77 source is found in the directory
../F77.

The program must be installed in a directory found in your PATH
environment variable.  In make.sh we use $scripting/$MACHINE_TYPE/bin,
but you can of course copy the executable to any other appropriate
directory.
