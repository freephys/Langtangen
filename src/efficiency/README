This directory tree aims at comparing the efficiency of various scripting
languages (e.g. Matlab, Perl, and Python).

integration - directory with scripts for integrating a function f(x)
              by the Trapezoidal rule (vectorized and scalar versions)

regex       - directory with scripts for reading numbers from a file using
              regular expressions

datatrans   - directory with scripts for comparing the efficiency of various
              versions of the datatrans1.py script written in different
              languages (the datatrans1.* scripts reside in various 
              directories)

Comparison of the efficiency of various constructs within the Python
language only appears in $scripting/src/py/examples/efficiency.
