q4w : questionnaire for the web
===============================

Define questions and answers, associated with a questionnaire, in a plain 
text file. Scripts can then parse the file and generate an interactive 
web page.

Key files:
----------

example1.q4w       - an example demonstrating the features of the
                     questionnaire
q4w-generate.py    - translate input file (ex. example1.q4w) into
                     HTML web form (example1.html)
q4w.cgi            - CGI script that reads the webform and stores the data
q4w-statistics.cgi - CGI script that displays the statistics of the
                     collected data

How to make a questionnaire:
----------------------------

 1. Make (say) myquiz.q4w file somewhere with questions and answers

 2. run::

       $scripting/src/cgi/q4w/q4w-generate.py myquiz.q4w language.no

    (if you want the Web pages in Norwegian, for English drop the second arg.
    or replace it by language.en - other language files can easily be made!)

 3. cd myquiz/  - everything is there. 

 4. Move myquiz/ to the right place on the right machine. Run chmod.files
    to make sure that files have the right writing permissions.


Troubleshooting:
----------------

Run the CGI scripts from the command line to test that they work
(just type their names!)
If not, the hardcoded path to python might be wrong. Try to use
either 
#!/usr/bin/python
or
#!/usr/local/bin/python
or another official python interpreter (the server might fail to
start your local python interpreter)

Common problem: Parts of the question is written as ordinary text
and the answer part is not properly lined up.
Cause: The question is not a single line. Recall that all questions
and answers must be on one single line! Fix the .q4w file and regenerate
til forms.

----------------

How to translate Web form into native language: 
(assume that example1.q4w is the input file)
1. Change "Submit" and "Reset" into suitable terms in example1.q4w
2. Change two expressions in q4w.cgi:
   "The following answers were recorded:" and
   "No answer was given"
3. Change two expressions in q4w-statistics.cgi:
   "Statistics of a webform"
   "average = "

F.ex.:
perl -pi.old~~ -e 's/Submit/Send evaluering/g;' example1.html
perl -pi.old~~ -e 's/Reset/Nullstill evaluering/g;' example1.html
perl -pi.old~~ -e 's/The following answers were recorded/Følgende svar er registrert/g;' q4w.cgi
perl -pi.old~~ -e 's/No answer was given/Intet svar er registrert/g;' q4w.cgi
Better: dictionary translate with the English expressions as keys stored in a
file language with various other languages in comments

How to avoid that users can read the statistics:
1. Remove the link at the end of the q4w.cgi file.
