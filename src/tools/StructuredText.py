'''Structured Text Manipulation

Parse a structured text string into a form that can be used with 
structured formats, like html.

Structured text is text that uses indentation and simple
symbology to indicate the structure of a document.  

A structured string consists of a sequence of paragraphs separated by
one or more blank lines.  Each paragraph has a level which is defined
as the minimum indentation of the paragraph.  A paragraph is a
sub-paragraph of another paragraph if the other paragraph is the last
preceding paragraph that has a lower level.

Special symbology is used to indicate special constructs:

- A single-line paragraph whose immediately succeeding paragraphs are lower
  level is treated as a header.

- A paragraph that begins with a '-', '*', or 'o' is treated as an
  unordered list (bullet) element.

- A paragraph that begins with a sequence of digits followed by a
  white-space character is treated as an ordered list element.

- A paragraph that begins with a sequence of sequences, where each
  sequence is a sequence of digits or a sequence of letters followed
  by a period, is treated as an ordered list element.

- A paragraph with a first line that contains some text, followed by
  some white-space and '--' is treated as
  a descriptive list element. The leading text is treated as the
  element title.

- Sub-paragraphs of a paragraph that ends in the word 'example' or the
  word 'examples', or '::' is treated as example code and is output as is.

- Text enclosed single quotes (with white-space to the left of the
  first quote and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second quote)
  is treated as example code.

- Text surrounded by '*' characters (with white-space to the left of the
  first '*' and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second '*')
  is emphasized.

- Text surrounded by '**' characters (with white-space to the left of the
  first '**' and whitespace or puctuation to the right of the second '**')
  is made strong.

- Text surrounded by '_' underscore characters (with whitespace to the left 
  and whitespace or punctuation to the right) is made underlined.

- Text encloded by double quotes followed by a colon, a URL, and concluded
  by punctuation plus white space, *or* just white space, is treated as a
  hyper link. For example:

    "Zope":http://www.zope.org/ is ...

  Is interpreted as '<a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> is ....'
  Note: This works for relative as well as absolute URLs.

- Text enclosed by double quotes followed by a comma, one or more spaces,
  an absolute URL and concluded by punctuation plus white space, or just
  white space, is treated as a hyper link. For example: 

    "mail me", mailto:amos@digicool.com.

  Is interpreted as '<a href="mailto:amos@digicool.com">mail me</a>.' 

- Text enclosed in brackets which consists only of letters, digits,
  underscores and dashes is treated as hyper links within the document.
  For example:
    
    As demonstrated by Smith [12] this technique is quite effective.

  Is interpreted as '... by Smith <a href="#12">[12]</a> this ...'. Together
  with the next rule this allows easy coding of references or end notes.

- Text enclosed in brackets which is preceded by the start of a line, two
  periods and a space is treated as a named link. For example:

    .. [12] "Effective Techniques" Smith, Joe ... 

  Is interpreted as '<a name="12">[12]</a> "Effective Techniques" ...'.
  Together with the previous rule this allows easy coding of references or
  end notes. 


- A paragraph that has blocks of text enclosed in '||' is treated as a
  table. The text blocks correspond to table cells and table rows are
  denoted by newlines. By default the cells are center aligned. A cell
  can span more than one column by preceding a block of text with an
  equivalent number of cell separators '||'. Newlines and '|' cannot
  be a part of the cell text. For example:

      |||| **Ingredients** ||
      || *Name* || *Amount* ||
      ||Spam||10||
      ||Eggs||3||

  is interpreted as::

    <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=2>
     <TR>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2> <strong>Ingredients</strong> </TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=1> <em>Name</em> </TD>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=1> <em>Amount</em> </TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=1>Spam</TD>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=1>10</TD>
     </TR>
     <TR>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=1>Eggs</TD>
      <TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=1>3</TD>
     </TR>
    </TABLE>

#
#   Structured Text module with table support
#
#   A paragraph that has blocks of text enclosed in '||' is treated as a
#   table. The text blocks correspond to table cells and table rows are
#   denoted by newlines. By default the cells are center aligned. You can
#   change the defaults by modifying the CELL,ROW and TABLE class
#   attributes in class Table. A cell can span more than one column by
#   preceding a block of text with an equivalent number of cell separators
#   '||'. Newlines and '|' cannot be a part of the cell text. If you need
#   newlines use <BR>. For example:
#
#        |||| **Ingredients** ||
#        || *Name* || *Amount* ||
#        ||Spam||10||
#        ||Eggs||3||
#
# Revision 1.23  1999/08/03 20:49:05  jim
# Fixed to allow list elements to introduce examples.
#
# Restructured _str using continue to avoid excessive nesting.
#
# Revision 1.22  1999/08/02 22:01:28  jim
# Fixed a bunch of bugs introduced by making ts_regex actually thread
# safe.
#
# Also localized a bunch of regular expressions
# using "static" variables (aka always default arguments).
#
# Revision 1.21  1999/08/02 13:26:52  jim
# paragraph_divider needs to be a regular (thread-unsafe) regex
# since it gets passed to ts_regex.split, which is thread-safe
# and wants to use regs.

# Revision 1.19  1999/07/15 16:43:15  jim
# Checked in Scott Robertson's thread-safety fixes.
#
# Revision 1.18  1999/03/24 00:03:18  klm
# Provide for relative links, eg <a href="file_in_same_dir">whatever</a>,
# as:
#
#   "whatever", :file_in_same_dir
#
# or
#
#   "whatever"::file_in_same_dir
#
# .__init__(): relax the second gsub, using a '*' instead of a '+', so
# the stuff before the ':' can be missing, and also do postprocessing so
# any resulting '<a href=":file_in_same_dir">'s have the superfluous ':'
# removed.  *Seems* good!

# Revision 1.17  1999/03/12 23:21:39  klm
# Gratuituous checkin to test my cvs *update* logging hook.
#
# Revision 1.16  1999/03/12 17:12:12  klm
# Added support for underlined elements, in the obvious way (and
# included an entry in the module docstring for it).
#
# Added an entry in the module docstring describing what i *guess* is
# the criterion for identifying header elements.  (I'm going to have to
# delve into and understand the framework a bit better before *knowing*
# this is the case.)
#
# Revision 1.15  1999/03/11 22:40:18  klm
# Handle links that include '#' named links.
#
# Revision 1.14  1999/03/11 01:35:19  klm
# Fixed a small typo, and refined the module docstring link example, in
# order to do a checkin to exercise the CVS repository mirroring.  Might
# as well include my last checkin message, with some substantial stuff:
#
# Links are now recognized whether or not the candidate strings are
# terminated with punctuation before the trailing whitespace.  The old
# form - trailing punctuation then whitespace - is preserved, but the
# punctuation is now unnecessary.
#
# The regular expressions are a bit more complicated, but i've factored
# out the common parts and but them in variables with suggestive names,
# which may make them easier to understand.
